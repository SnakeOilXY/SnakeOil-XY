# SnakeOil XY

Small size, affordable and fast CoreXY 3D printer. Inspired by [HevORT](https://miragec79.github.io/HevORT/), [Voron](https://vorondesign.com/) and [Annex Engineering](https://github.com/Annex-Engineering) design.  
This project was started as [HevORT lite](https://github.com/ChipCE/HevORT-lite), a trimdown design based on [HevORT corexy](https://miragec79.github.io/HevORT/) 3D printer. In the process of trying to make the printer easier to enclosure, parts easier to print without support, I ended up with redesigned all of the parts.

<code>The first release ETA is scheduled on the end of August 2021.</code>

## About this project

- Small printer that stable and can print fast ([Check the previous version speed benchy run](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDmU6JHQ-gc)).
- Use off-the-shell parts
- Does not need special tool to make the parts
- Affordable price

## Development progress

- [x] New XY axis
- [x] Foot and panel mount
- [ ] Flex sheet auto detect
- [x] Belted Z and 3 points leveling
- [x] EVA2 toolhead system compatible
- [ ] Brush nozzle cleaning
- [ ] Circular air filter
- [x] Filament spool inside machine chamber
- [x] Standard 3030 T-slot frame support
- [ ] Carbon fiber X gantry
- [ ] AIO filament runout + jam detector + width sensor
- [x] Move XY motors inside chamber for easier enclosure. (XY motors can still be isolated from chamber with custom cut panel)
